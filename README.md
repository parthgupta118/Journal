## Deployment
### Static Server
For environments using Node, the easiest way to handle this would be to install serve and let it handle the rest:

```bash
    $ npm install -g serve
    $ serve -s build
```
The last command shown above will serve your static site on the port 5000. Like many of serveâ€™s internal settings, the port can be adjusted using the -l or --listen flags:

``` bash
    $ serve -s build -l 4000
```
Run this command to get a full list of the options available:

## Back-end

### How to run

First, we have to installed Node.js, which can be done by :

``` bash
    sudo apt-get install node.js
```

and install npm packages by:

```bash
    npm install
```


Then, export the private keys using : 

``` bash
    $ export journal_jwtPrivateKey=<Any Keyname>
```
    and then run
``` bash
    $ node index.js
```

or you can continuously monitor the file in the terminal by running:

```bash
    $ nodemon index.js
```
Now, your web server is ruuning to serve the request by the client-side. Visit http://localhost:3001 and you will see a message saying.
